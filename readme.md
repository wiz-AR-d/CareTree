# CareTree: Modular Clinical Decision Support Framework

## One-line Project Description

An offline-syncable, rule-based triage framework that enables doctors to visually design customizable decision-tree protocols and empowers nurses with step-by-step guided triage execution, enhanced by NLP & ML-assisted symptom extraction.

# 1. Problem Statement

## Problem Title  
Inflexible and Non-Adaptive Triage Systems in Resource-Constrained Healthcare Settings

## Problem Description  

In primary care clinics, rural health centers, and field healthcare programs, frontline patient assessment is often conducted by nurses or community health workers rather than specialized physicians.

Most existing triage systems rely on:

- Static paper-based flowcharts  
- Manual checklists  
- Hardcoded digital systems  
- Non-configurable decision trees  

These systems are:

- Difficult to update across distributed clinics  
- Hard to navigate during high-pressure situations  
- Not adaptable to regional or clinic-specific needs  
- Dependent on stable internet connectivity  
- Lacking structured scoring flexibility  

As a result, triage decisions become inconsistent, slower, and prone to human error — especially in high-volume or low-connectivity environments.

---

## Target Users  

- Nurses and paramedics  
- Community health workers  
- Primary Health Centers (PHCs)  
- Rural clinics  
- Field health programs  
- Medical supervisors and protocol designers  

---

## Existing Gaps  

- No modular triage builder tailored for frontline healthcare  
- Limited offline-syncable digital decision tools  
- Poor protocol version control and update mechanisms  
- Lack of assistive tools for rapid symptom input  
- Rigid scoring systems that cannot be customized  

---

# 2. Problem Understanding & Approach

## Root Cause Analysis  

The inefficiencies in frontline triage stem from:

- Static protocol distribution (manual or paper-based updates)  
- Cognitive overload when navigating complex symptom trees  
- Lack of digital infrastructure optimized for low-connectivity regions  
- No clear separation between protocol design and execution  

Existing tools either focus on diagnosis instead of structured triage or require continuous internet access, making them unreliable in rural settings.

---

## Solution Strategy  

Our approach focuses on:

1. Designing a configurable rule-based decision engine instead of hardcoded logic  
2. Separating Doctor Protocol Design Mode from Nurse Execution Mode  
3. Implementing an offline-syncable web architecture  
4. Enhancing usability with NLP & ML-assisted symptom extraction  
5. Maintaining deterministic, explainable triage logic  

The system prioritizes usability, modularity, and reliability.

---

# 3. Proposed Solution

## Solution Overview  

CareTree is a unified, role-based clinical decision support platform designed to simplify both protocol creation and triage execution.

It addresses two major usability gaps:

- Doctors struggle to modify and distribute structured triage pathways.  
- Nurses struggle to navigate complex symptom trees under time pressure.  

CareTree solves both by providing:

- A visual, modular flowchart builder for doctors.  
- A guided, step-by-step triage interface for nurses.  

---

## Core Idea  

Instead of static paper flowcharts or rigid digital checklists, CareTree introduces a configurable decision-tree framework where:

- Doctors visually build and modify triage pathways using intuitive flowchart logic.  
- Nurses follow a guided, interactive triage sequence that dynamically presents only the relevant next question.  
- The engine automatically determines the next step based on previous inputs.  
- Risk scoring and urgency classification are handled deterministically.  
- Offline synchronization ensures uninterrupted use in low-connectivity environments.  

The focus is not just digitalization — but reducing cognitive load and improving clarity during patient assessment.

---

## Key Features  

### 🩺 For Doctors (Protocol Builder Ease)

- Visual flowchart-based protocol creation  
- Drag-and-drop node management  
- Easy conditional branching definition  
- Editable scoring and priority assignment  
- Version-controlled updates  
- No need to rewrite or redistribute paper guides  
- Rapid protocol modification without technical coding  

Doctors can adapt triage logic in minutes instead of redesigning static manuals.

---

### 👩‍⚕️ For Nurses (Execution Ease)

- Guided step-by-step questioning  
- Automatic next-step navigation  
- Clear urgency classification output  
- Structured recommendations at terminal nodes  
- Reduced need to manually interpret flowcharts  
- **Offline Functionality:** Progressive Web App (PWA) caching and IndexedDB offline logic.
- **Background Sync:** Queues offline submissions and bulk-syncs when internet is restored.

Instead of searching through complex charts, nurses are simply guided to the next logical question automatically.

This reduces:

- Decision fatigue  
- Navigation errors  
- Time-to-classification

# 15. Future Scope & Scalability  

## Short-Term  

- OCR-Based Medical Flowchart Import

One of the most impactful planned additions is OCR (Optical Character Recognition) scanning of pre-existing medical flowcharts. This feature will allow doctors and clinical assistants to simply photograph or upload a physical or digital flowchart — such as a treatment algorithm, triage pathway, or care protocol — and have it automatically parsed and converted into a structured, interactive protocol within CareTree.

This significantly lowers the barrier to adoption: rather than manually recreating complex decision trees from scratch, healthcare teams can digitise their existing standardised workflows in seconds. Since most hospitals and clinics already operate with well-established paper or PDF-based flowcharts, this bridge between legacy resources and our digital platform ensures that onboarding onto CareTree requires minimal additional effort. It enables teams to ship their institutional knowledge directly into the app — making the transition seamless, faster, and more accurate. 

## Long-Term  

- ML-based risk calibration   
- Public health trend detection  
- Standalone exportable runtime package  

---

# 16. Known Limitations  

- Requires a first time internet connection for protocol synchronization  

---

# 17. Impact  

CareTree transforms frontline patient assessment by:

- Making protocol design modular and intuitive for medical supervisors  
- Converting complex decision trees into guided, interactive workflows  
- Reducing ambiguity in early-stage triage decisions  
- Improving speed and consistency of patient prioritization  
- Enabling reliable operation in low-connectivity environments  

CareTree shifts triage from static reference charts to an adaptive, structured decision-support experience.
